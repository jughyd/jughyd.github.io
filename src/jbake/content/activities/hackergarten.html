<p>Hackergarten is a craftmen's workshop, classroom, a laboratory, a social circle, a writing group, a playground, and an artist's studio.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create something that others can use; whether it be working software, improved documentation, or better educational materials.</p>
<p>Our intent is to end each meeting with a patch or similar contribution submitted to an open and public project.</p>
<p>Membership is open to anyone willing to contribute their time.</p>
